# **ShipShape**

## A game for families

### Synopsis

ShipShape is a game about pairing two (or more) unrelated characters from different franchises and universes and explaining why they're perfect for each other and their family -- whatever that means to you. It's an explorative game where you and your friends cnad find a deeper meaning of connection.

### Goal

Ship two characters from unrelated franchises and make your case for why they're the perfect family. There are at least three axes for your peers to judge: their compatibility, their compassion, and their degree of "family" -- whatever that means to you. So, pick two (or more!) characters and set them up for success.

### Gameplay

The standard game consists of three rounds. In each round, players proceed in clockwise, alphabetical, or any other order throughout the group so that everyone presents their case once. After a player presents their case, all other players vote for whether their case has been made adequately. No one contests that a family is what you make it; however, everyone contests whether the argument helps that family exist. **Important note:** It's a game, not of definition, and not of debate, but of collaborative consensus. (See [Addedum A](#addendum-a) for more information on ShipShape's game theory.)

If the majority agrees that the case is sound, that player gets 2 points for the round. If not, 1 point.

In standard gameplay, at the end of 3 rounds, points are tallied and winners (note: multiple winners is encouraged) are crowned. Those players have successfully shipped characters in a *shipshape* manner. In extended gameplay, rounds progress until collective agreement that the game's pretty much over.

### Scoring

In standard gameplay, a player can earn a maximum of 6 points. Any player with 6 points has successfully defended the existence of three families, and that's worth celebrating! So players with maximum points get lifetime bragging rights of the title "ShipWright" and all social ramifications that entails. >_0

Other players claim the title "ShipMate" for their efforts. (Note: You can be a ShipWright in one game and ShipMate in another. Either way, you're recognized.)

### Flexibility

ShipShape is a game meant to be enjoyed by all. Any text in these rules can be adjusted to suit your playgroup -- from the scoring to the goal to the way the game is presented. As long as you have fun with ShipShape, you can modify anything you'd like. Feel free to ask others what makes the game work for them! And if/when you do, please bring that player in, however that means to you.

### Last thoughts

We hope you enjoy **ShipShape**. And we hope this games has a positive impact on your life.

#### Addendum A

ShipShape is a game meant to bring people together. It's competitive, but collaborative. If you like games like Jackbox's "Talking Points" or group roleplay such as "Dungeons and Dragons," and especially if you like defending your wild theories, you'll probably enjoy this compassionate approach to building a family. This is not a game that elevates one person above others, but seeks to collectively elevate our perceptions of ourselves and what a family is. A lot of modern game design is approached from an indivdualistic perspective, so ShipShape tries to rein in that trend and accelerate fun through an emotional approach.
