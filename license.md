# License terms for ShipShape and stuff

Hey y'all; Lilith here. I'm working on this game and license and stuff and I think it's worth protecting, legally speaking. This license expresses my intent for ShipShape's use. It doesn't tell you how to play the game; rather, it explains how to share the game with others if you wanna do that kind of thing.

Okay! Let's go.

## Usage and modification

Here's how you can share and modify ShipShape.

### Noncommercial use and stuff

ShipShape is licensed for noncommercial\* use under these terms:

- This license must accompany ShipShape if it's shared; an easy way to share this license is to link to this ShipShape GitHub repo (yes I'm aware of the circular loop and I find it quite twee)

\* Please do not try to profit from a game that elevates group expression over personal gain. But, if you do sell something based on ShipShape, there is a section about that [called Commercial Use](#commercial-use).

### Commercial use and whatnot

ShipShape is licensed for commercial use\*\* under these terms:

- If you sell something based on ShipShape, ya gotta link back to the GitHub repo (yeah I'm still on the GitHub thing) in an exceedingly clear fashion (for example, a printed URL is fine, but so is a QR code with an explanation of how to reach the original ShipShape)
- If you sell something based on ShipShape, and it does pretty well, please make some kinda donation and tell us about it. We'd love to highlight the good that gets done in this world. (Maybe we'll make a donors list and append to it now and then? Idk yet. But please let us know somehow.)

\*\* If you're profiting from sharing ShipShape, no matter how altered, that's commercial use. And like, it's cool, kinda, but, like, be nice about that, please.

## Translation

- You may translate ShipShape into any medium or language, as long as you link back to this GitHub repo (y'all I think this GitHub thing is the way to go, srsly)

## Miscellaneous terms

- There's nothing else to add at this stage. I hope you have fun, and maybe learn something new about how everyone sees family. I think there's good stuff in ShipShape games. I hope you think so, too.
